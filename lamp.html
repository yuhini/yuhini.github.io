This shift was not driven by corporate interest, but by the collaborative efforts of DIY communities around the world, who shared their experiments, findings, and printer designs openly, for little to no cost. It is because of these communities that you and I have the privilege of using 3D printers today.<br><br>Right now, ‘hobbyist’ printers are getting cheaper and better, and industrial printers are not only seen as tools for prototyping, but for making ready-to-ship products. Finding myself in the midst of this revolution, I felt the need to noy only participate, but ask…</bod></div>

Initially, I thought about how I might teach somebody the basics & fundamentals of 3D printing, to get them over the initial learning curve. Through some research however, I learned that <bod_bold>it’s more important to empower somebody to use 3D printing, rather than focusing on teaching technical skills & information</bod_bold>. So what’s the difference?</bod></div>

            <div class="section_three_body"><h2>What is 3D printer empowerment?</h2><br><bod>When using a 3D printer, to feel empowered is to have the confidence to make anything that comes to mind, unafraid of facing the challenges that will inevitably arise. Whilst we can teach someone how to use a 3D printer, the confidence to use a 3D printer cannot be taught, it can only be earned.<br><br>In order to help someone earn the confidence to use the 3D printer, we have to provide opportunities that will allow them to <bod_bold>engage with the 3D printer using their prior experience</bod_bold>, whilst <bod_bold>exposing them to some new & challenging concepts</bod_bold>.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_three_body"><h2>How might we design opportunities that are both challenging & engaging?</h2><br><bod>Rather, what does it mean for this opportunity to be both challenging & engaging? It means that whoever engages in this opportunity should feel exposed to unfamiliar ideas. But they should still feel able to exercise the skills & knowledge they already possess to navigate this unfamiliarity. If they ‘succeed’, they should feel a sense of accomplishment! But if they make a mistake, they should be able to learn and recover.</bod></div>

Instead, it is through the 'randomness' and hence <bod_bold>individuality</bod_bold> of these experiences that I hope each person will feel able to <bod_bold>take ownership of the project and process</bod_bold>.</div>

Though ultimately the build experience is more important than the product itself, I wanted to give people a tool that would help them make their future projects.<br><br>For those that have a 3D printer at home, 3D printers transform our domestic spaces from places of comfort, to places of making & experimentation. Similarly, a task light can turn any regular surface, be it the floor or the dining table, into a work surface. For other reasons as well, I thought that a task light would be the perfect product to make.</bod></div>
