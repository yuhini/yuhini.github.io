            <div class="section_one_body"><h2>Why do we pack lunch to work?</h2><br><bod>Hundreds of years ago, eating lunch was a domestic activity. Later, throughout the industrial revolution, eating lunch at designated lunch breaks became the norm. Since people no longer had the time to go home and eat, many people started to pack their lunches from home instead - a habit which many of us practice today.<br><br>With changing modes of work, the rise of health-consciousness & financial sensitivity in the media, an increase in demand for individualization in outdated, homogenized workplaces…how do we navigate the factors that affect the way we eat during our lunch breaks, and how can we modernize the lunchbox to address these changes?</bod></div>

            <div class="section_two_body"><h2>What is eating lunch at work actually like?</h2><br><bod>To start, I sent out a survey to college students & young professionals to learn about their current lunch break habits & conditions. Though I learned much, one unexpected finding caught my attention.<br><br>Of all participants, half pack their lunch, and half buy takeout/eat in a restaurant. <bod_bold>Of those who don’t currently pack their lunch, many wanted to start doing so</bod_bold>, to eat healthier & save money.<br><br>This led me to ask a simple but complex question:</bod></div>

            <div class="section_three_body"><h2>If we know packing lunch is good for us,<br>why don't we do it more often?</h2><br><bod>Seeing this as an opportunity to design a solution, I conducted interviews & observations with people who pack their lunch, and people who used to pack their lunch, but stopped. I hoped to gather their solutions & pain points in order to develop a concept. In particular, a way to <bod_bold>motivate people to pack their lunch more often</bod_bold>.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_three_body"><h2>A realization...</h2><br><bod>Rather than learning about how I could develop a solution, I learned that packing lunch is much more complex than it seems. Though we know the benefits of packing lunch, to actually feel its benefits, we have to habitualize it, which is a huge lifestyle change.<br><br>Instead of thinking about how I might ‘motivate’ someone to pack their lunch in the short term, I focused on how I can <bod_bold>make packing lunch more enjoyable in the long term</bod_bold>.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_five_body"><h2>Going back to the research...</h2><br><bod>I set my sights on designing a lunchbox for people who want to start packing lunch more often, one that they can carry for the rest of their journey.<br><br>I went back into my research to identify every point at which the user would interact with the lunchbox. From there, I focused on <bod_bold>key touchpoints and pain points</bod_bold>, and thought about how these small interactions influence the user’s experience with the lunchbox, and by extension, their experience packing lunch.</div>

            <div class="section_six_body"><h2>Setting design goals</h2><br><bod>After some thought, I set some design goals, which I think will help someone nurture more positive feelings towards packing lunch, overtime.<br><br><br><bod_bold>1. Feel good in the hands at every interaction.</bod_bold> Transporting it, eating out of it, cleaning it…I want to make it easier for someone to carry this lunchbox in their hands, so that they can eat away from their usual desks.<br><br><bod_bold>2. Feel welcoming.</bod_bold> Packing lunch often means cooking your own food, and I want people to feel proud of the food they made. The lunchbox should feel receptive and complement the food you put inside.<br><br><bod_bold>3. Look ‘unique’.</bod_bold> Like any other habit or routine, packing lunch isn’t glamorous. Despite this, I want the lunchbox to feel ‘ceremonial’ in a way, so that it celebrates your efforts when you’ve made the time to pack your lunch.<br><br><bod_bold>3.5. But also look muted</bod_bold>…the people purchasing this lunchbox aren’t just looking for a tool to carry the lunch, but a tool to help them gain some autonomy over their lives. Packing lunch is just one way of mastering our health, finance, and time. In honor of that, I think the lunchbox should feel like a blank canvas, because it’s the user’s own efforts that will help them succeed, not the lunchbox itself.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_seven_body"><h2>Concept Sketching & Explorations</h2><br><bod>I started by sketching to navigate my initial/’visceral’ reaction to my design goals, to find some shapes that provided feelings of comfort & warmth, that also had a ceremonial/ritualistic quality. To ground myself, I also explored the proportions of the hand in relation to the container, by envisioning how someone would hold this container when traveling and eating.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_eight_body"><h2>Form Development</h2><br><bod>With some overall shapes in mind, I transitioned to more precise formgiving, focusing on shapes that would feel great in the hands, and also visually make the container feel appealing and welcoming. I worked back and forth with some quick foam modeling, trying to find the curves that help the container sit comfortably & naturally in the palms & fingers.<br><br>As I started to close in on the overall shape of the container, I started to work in some smaller details and features, thinking about how they can compliment the larger shapes already established, physically and visually.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_nine_body"><h2>CAD & 3D Printing</h2><br><bod>Working in CAD gave me the chance to be really precise about the shape & details of the lunchbox, so I made sure to print many scale models to test out my ideas. As I started to hone down on the larger shapes & details of the lunchbox, I also incorporated other features such as a silicone gasket and a seal, which would be cast from a 3D printed mold.</bod></div>
