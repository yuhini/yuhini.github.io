            <div class="section_one_body"><h2>Kids reaally want to pull fire alarms...</h2><br><bod>At the beginning of this project, I took a tour of the Children’s Institute of CMU and talked to some of their teachers to understand where there might be opportunities to explore for this redesign. Among other things, I learned that <bod_bold>kids pulling the fire alarm for fun/curiosity is a real concern</bod_bold>. So much so that the teachers put a big bin underneath this alarm to deter them.<br><br>I also learned a lot about the procedures surrounding fire safety in a kindergarten, and the dynamics between teacher, child, and classroom during a real emergency. Given the opportunity to design specifically for the classroom, what are some things that should be taken into account?</bod></div>

            <div class="section_two_body"><h2>Mediating the relationship between child, teacher, and environment</h2><br><bod>The solution to detering children from pulling the fire alarm won't be simple as putting a big lock box over it. From the perspective of the <bod_bold>teacher</bod_bold>, the fire alarm should:<br>1. Require very low cognitive load to use. As soon as a fire is spotted and the alarm is pulled, teachers need to escort the children in a safe, orderly manner, which is an incredibly demanding task.<br>2. Compliment the teacher’s reinforcements and pose as a thing that is strictly ‘off-limits’.<br><br>From the perspective of the <bod_bold>child</bod_bold>, the fire alarm should:<br>1. Provide a sense of security. Not so guarded & prominent that it serves as a constant reminder for danger, but not so hidden & cryptic that it causes anxiety.<br>2. Calmly communicate when it’s been activated.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_three_body"><h2>Initial Form Explorations</h2><br><bod>Through some sketches & prototyping, I decided on a shape that would <bod_bold>loom slightly over a child’s head and hide the switch, but present it at an angle that is accessible to an adult</bod_bold>. This not only makes the fire alarm easier to use, but it reinforces the alarm as ‘adult-only’ by way of height difference and form semanatics.</bod></div>

            <div class="section_four_body"><h2>Form Development & Prototyping</h2><br><bod>With a general shape in mind, I worked towards a form that has a good balance of curved surfaces and sharp lines to maintain a sense of security but also seamlessness that’s fitting in a cluttered classroom.<br><br>The handle is designed to look somewhat concelead and only ‘peek' over the lip that looms over the child's view when pulled - which sublty communicates that the alarm has been activated.<br><br>At this point, I also experimented with implementing LED lights to emphasize the ‘on-state’ of the fire alarm. </bod></div>

            <div class="section_five_body"><h2>Actuation & LEDs</h2><br><bod>Using SolidWorks, I modelled the interior and exterior of the alarm to produce a functional mockup. I wanted the handle to have some amount of smooth travel, encounter a lot of resistance right before it’s activated, and provide clear tactile feedback when activated. The circuit that powers the LEDs uses a 9V battery and copper contacts. </bod></div>
